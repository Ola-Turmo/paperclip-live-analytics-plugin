# Agent Analytics Live for Paperclip

Live Agent Analytics inside a Paperclip company workspace.

The plugin adds a live page, sidebar entry, and settings page so operators can see current traffic without leaving Paperclip.
The dashboard widget is intentionally omitted until a real Agent Analytics project is connected, which keeps paused or unconfigured companies free of dead dashboard surfaces.

The important setup rule is that this is a multi-company plugin: each Paperclip company keeps its own plugin configuration and chooses its own Agent Analytics project.

Docs:

- [Set up Agent Analytics for your Paperclip company](https://docs.agentanalytics.sh/guides/paperclip/)
- [Paperclip Live Plugin](https://docs.agentanalytics.sh/reference/paperclip-live-plugin/)

## Install in Paperclip

1. In Paperclip, open `Settings` -> `Plugins`.
2. Click `Install Plugin`.
3. Install this package:

```text
@agent-analytics/paperclip-live-analytics-plugin
```

4. Open the plugin `Configure` page.
5. If the account is not set up yet, use the Paperclip setup task shown in the plugin help panel or the docs guide first.
6. Log in with your existing Agent Analytics account in the browser.
7. In that company workspace, choose the Agent Analytics project from the plugin settings page.
8. Open the company live page from the sidebar.

If you run multiple Paperclip companies, repeat those steps in each company workspace. The selected project is per company, not a single global plugin setting for the whole Paperclip instance.

## Requirements

- An existing Agent Analytics account with live-read access
- A Paperclip instance with plugin support

First-time Agent Analytics setup for Paperclip should be driven by the Paperclip task flow in the docs guide, not by this login popup:

[Set up Agent Analytics for your Paperclip company](https://docs.agentanalytics.sh/guides/paperclip/)
